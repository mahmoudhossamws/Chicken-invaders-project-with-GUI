## ▶️ How the Game Works

1. **Startup:** Game window (800x600) loads with a space background.
2. **Player Controls:** Move left/right with arrow keys; shoot with the spacebar.
3. **Enemy Spawning:** Every 2 seconds, a new chicken spawns at a random X-coordinate.
4. **Collision Detection:** Bullets destroy enemies; enemies hurt player on contact or when reaching the bottom.
5. **Game Over:** Health reaches zero → game ends → message box shows final score.
